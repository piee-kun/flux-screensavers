# Screensavers for Flux

### [You can now buy Flux as a Windows screensaver →][store]
Enjoy staring at it for hours as your computer idles and help support development. More platforms coming soon!

---

I’m working on creating native screensavers for [Flux][flux] — a fluid simulation inspired by the MacOS Drift screensaver.

This repository contains:

- `flux-ffi` — a foreign function interface for the [Flux library][flux].
- Native screensavers for the following platforms:
  - [MacOS](#macos)
  - [Windows](#windows)
  - ~Linux~

## Build for platform

### MacOS

Build with XCode.

```sh
cd macos
xcodebuild -project Flux.xcodeproj/ -scheme Flux build
````

XCode should automatically build the FFI crate. In case it doesn’t, here’s how to do it manually.

```sh
cd flux-ffi
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.10
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
lipo target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/libflux.a target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/libflux.a -create -output libflux.a
```

### Windows

Cross-compile to Windows from NixOS.

```sh
nix build
```

I haven’t tested native builds on Windows. You’ll need Rust and a static build of SDL2.
